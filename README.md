# Pework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide webpage was the first of many coding projects I will complete during this course. We started with the basic structure of a site using HTML, built on that with design elements using CSS and finished by testing basic elements of JavaScript to provide some funcationality to this web page. Building this webpage provided first-hand experience at not only coding but also git flow and the overall process for how create we applications works. I learned how to use GitHub, repositories, my local branch, vs code, terminal and how to search for answers using the course, tutors, Ask BCS and of course, Google.
